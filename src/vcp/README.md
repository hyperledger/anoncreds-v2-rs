# Introduction

This directory contains work towards defining and implementing an abstraction to decouple verifiable
credential formats and presentation/proof requests on one hand from underlying cryptography
libraries on the other.  Test code related to this work, including the test framework described
below, is under the [tests/vcp](../../tests/vcp) directory.

So far, in this repo, we have instantiated our abstraction with only one underlying cryptography library,
which is the cryptography library that is part of the [AnonCreds v2](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-v2-rs-private) repo.  We refer to that cryptography
library as AC2C in order to distinguish it from the broader project.  In internal work, we have
instantated our Haskell implementation with both AC2C the [DockNetwork crypto](https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/) library (which we call DNC); we plan
to translate this to Rust and add it to this repo in future.

The information below is intended to help the reader approach this code after gaining some
familiarity with the work by reviewing the SLIDES-LINK-TODO that we presented at
[IIW](https://internetidentityworkshop.com) in October, 2024.

This work is by [Harold Carr](https://github.com/haroldcarr) and [Mark Moir](https://github.com/mark-moir) of Oracle Labs, and [Henry Blanchette](https://github.com/rybla)
of the University of Maryland at College Park, during his Summer 2024 internship at Oracle Labs.

# Caveats

This is research work in progress aimed at exploring and demonstrating the benefits and feasibility
of establishing an abstraction between credential formats and cryptography libraries.  This work
should in no way be considered for use in production or for any purpose other than engaging in such
exploration.  In particular,

-   This Rust work has been contributed by three different developers with different levels of
    experience and expertise in the relevant languages and knowledge about the domain and details of
    the internal Haskell prototype on which it is based.
-   Some code was written by an intern who is experienced in Rust, and some was written by his Oracle
    Labs mentors at different times during their Rust learning process.  Therefore, different styles,
    tastes, and levels of expertise are evident in different parts of the code.  While we have made
    progress towards more consistent styles throughout, this is not complete.
-   There are quite a few TODOs, including some that would undermine security if left undone before
    this code were used in a practical application.
-   While we hope to eventually contribute to [Hyperledger AnonCreds, v2](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-v2-rs) based on this work, we are not
    raising a Pull Request at this stage. Rather, we have made this work public in order to facilitate
    feedback and engagement towards something that we can offer as a contribution.

# User abstraction

From an application/user perspective, our abstraction is defined by the
`PlatformAPI` type in [./api.rs](./api.rs). There are several possible ways to access it:

-   By using the `implement_platform_api_using` function in [./api_utils.rs](./api_utils.rs) and providing an instance of
    `CryptoInterface`, such as `CRYPTO_INTERFACE_AC2C` (defined in [./impl/ac2c/impl_ac2c.rs](./impl/ac2c/impl_ac2c.rs)), and calling
    its methods directly.  See [6.1](#orgf6130d9) for more details.
-   By accessing the functionality via a Swagger/OpenAPI interface. We have previously built an HTTP
    server serving such an interface built automatically from our Haskell prototype. However,
    this is internal work, and is not up-to-date.  Future work may include doing similar in Rust.
-   Via our test framework, described below.  We recommend this approach as the easiest way to get
    started gaining some familiarity with our interface because, as detailed below, the test framework
    handles a lot of common setup tasks and manages data for all roles, which a user would otherwise
    have to do explicitly.  In the sections below, we first describe the test framework and how tests can be
    added without any programming. We then explain how those tests connect to the API and to the
    underlying implementation.

We note that there are a number of additional tests, beyond those that use the test framework.  These
are less general, more historic, less well organised, etc.  We recommend focusing on the JSON tests
that are run by the test framework.


<a id="org5249764"></a>

# The test framework

The goal of our test framework is to enable easily specifying a sequence of actions that exercise
the API and test its behavior in various scenarios.  Tests are expressed in JSON and automatically
run by our framework.  A new JSON test can be added to
[../../tests/data/JSON/TestSequences/LicenseSubscription](../../tests/data/JSON/TestSequences/LicenseSubscription), where there are a number of examples
already. Tests are generated at compile time from these JSON files. Therefore, after adding a new
test it is necessary to ensure recompilation, using these steps, for example:

    cd <root of this repo>
    touch tests/data/JSON/TestSequences/LicenseSubscription/*.json  # It is *not* sufficient to touch only the new test
    make test


<a id="org255520c"></a>

## JSON test file naming and contents

JSON test files contain the following fields:

-   `descr` - a short description of the test
-   `provenance` - information to enable finding where the test came from, how it was generated, etc.
-   `comment` (optional) - a comment about the test
-   `testseq` - an array of `TestStep`, see below

The filename for the JSON test must be `json_test_nnn_<str>` for some three-digit `nnn`, where `str` is
the contents of its `descr` field.

Including `expected_to_fail` in the test's `descr` field (and therefore in its filename) "reverses" the
test, so that if the test (at the level of the test framework <span class="underline">succeeds</span>, then the test is reported as
a failure.

In addition to running all tests using `make test`, an individual test can be run using its `descr` field.  For example,
to run only the test described in the next section:

    cd <root of this repo>
    cargo test example_single_issuer_and_credential_in_accum_no_update


<a id="org4200c9f"></a>

## Overview of test framework

The test framework maintains state representing all data of all roles (Issuers, Holders,
Authorities, and Revocation Managers. It is assumed that there is a single, unnamed verifier). (This
is represented in the `TestState` data type in
[../../tests/vcp/impl/general/utility_function_types.rs](../../tests/vcp/impl/general/utility_function_types.rs).)

Each `TestStep` updates the state and/or checks whether some condition holds in that state.  The
implementation of each `TestStep` invokes one or more methods in the API as noted in the description
for each `TestStep` below. For convenience and ease of use, some `TestSteps` model multiple real world
events. For example, the `Sign` step models an Issuer signing a credential, sending the signature to
the requesting Holder, the Holder receiving the signature and storing it locally.

We make the simplifying assumption that each Holder can possess at most one credential signed by
each Issuer. This enables referring to credentials by the label of the Issuer that signed them.


<a id="orgc2b7d82"></a>

## An example

Before describing each `TestStep` in detail, we first walk through the example in
[../../tests/data/JSON/TestSequences/LicenseSubscription/json_test_028_example_single_issuer_and_credential_in_accum_no_update.json](../../tests/data/JSON/TestSequences/LicenseSubscription/json_test_028_example_single_issuer_and_credential_in_accum_no_update.json)
(from ).

Each `TestStep` in the JSON file has a `tag` field that identifies the kind of step, and a `contents`
field that provides its arguments.

The first step in our example is a `CreateIssuer` step, which establishes signing keys for an Issuer
identified by the label given in the first argument, for a schema defined in the second.  In the example, we
create an Issuer with label `DMV` and a schema with five attributes, the last of which is an
accumulator member (`CTAccumulatorMember`), meaning that it is a field that will be used for set
membership (e.g., for revocation).

Although using the API directly would require creating and initializing `AccumulatorData` for each
such field, the second (`CreateAccumulators)` step creates and initializes an accumulator for each
`CTAccumulatorMember` field in the schema (only one in our example).

In the third (`SignCredential`) step, Issuer `DMV` signs a credential for `Holder1`, specifying values for each of
the five attributes indicated by the schema specified when the `DMV` Issuer was created.

The fourth step (`AccumulatorAddRemove`) adds a "batch" of accumulator members (consisting of only
`Holder1`'s accumulator member in this case) to the accumulator associated with attribute 4 for `DMV`,
and also removes a "batch" of accumulator members, which is empty in this case.  Furthermore, for
each accumulator member added to the accumulator, a new `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` is created and associated with the
specified Holder's credential for the specified Issuer (if the specified Issuer has not been
created, or if no credential has been signed by that Issuer for a specified Holder, then an error
will be generated).  At this stage, because one batch has been applied to the accumulator since it
was created, the new witness is valid for `BatchSeqNo` `1`, which will be important when we
come to request proving membership in the accumulator (see the `InAccum` step below).

The fifth step (`Reveal`) says that `Holder1` should reveal attributes `0` and `3` from its credential signed
by `DMV`. Note that this is simply adding to the requirements that will be used when
creating a proof later.

Similarly, the sixth step (`InAccum`) says that `Holder1` should prove that its accumulator member is a
member of the accumulator associated with attribute `4` at `BatchSeqNo` `1`.

Finally, the seventh step (`CreateAndVerifyProof`) attempts to create a proof satisfying all of the
requirements established for `Holder1` so far in the test, and to then verify that proof. The
`TestExpectation` is specified to be `BothSucceedNoWarning`. Therefore, the test will fail if either
creating or verifying the proof fails or issues a warning.  Apart from checking that a proof can be
created and verified, the `CreateAndVerifyProof` step verifies that the revealed attributes are the same
as the one signed in the relevant credential, and (in examples involving decryption) that the
decrypted values match the original signed values.

    -   `create_accumulator_data` (once for each created accumulator)


<a id="orgcf63d43"></a>

### SignCredential

1.  Effects

    -   Creates new credential (`SignatureAndRelatedData`) signed by specified Issuer with specified
        `DataValue` s for specified `Holder` ("related data" includes `DataValue` s signed and an empty map
        that will be used to store `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` es when they are created by an
        `AccumulatorAddRemove` step).

2.  Arguments

    -   `IssuerLabel`: label identifying previously created Issuer
    -   `HolderLabel`: label identifying Holder
    -   `[ DataValue ]`: list of values to be signed, one for each attribute of Issuer's schema

3.  API method(s) invoked

    -   `sign`


<a id="org886e415"></a>

### AccumulatorAddRemove

1.  Effects

    -   Add some `DataValue` s to and remove some `DataValue` s from accumulator associated with specified
        Issuer and attribute.
    -   Each `DataValue` added generates an `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` for the new accumulator value,
        which is stored in the `SignatureAndRelatedData` associated with specified Holder and the
        `AccumlatorBatchSeqNo` of this batch of additions and removals.  This information can be used by
        subsequent `UpdateAccumulatorWitness` and `CreateAndVerify` steps.
    -   Stores "update information" associated with updating `Accumulatormembershipwitness` es
        from previous `AccumulatorBatchSeqNo` to new one,for use by subsequent `UpdateAccumulatorWitness` steps

2.  Arguments

    -   `IssuerLabel`
    -   `CredAttrIndex`: attribute index identifying relevant accumulator associated with specified Issuer
    -   `Map HolderLabel DataValue`: `DataValue` s to be added to specified accumulator and Holders to
        receive respective generated witnesses
    -   `[ DataValue ]`: `DataValue` s to be removed from specified accumulator

3.  API method(s) invoked

    -   `accumulator_add_remove`


<a id="org50caf53"></a>

### UpdateAccumulatorWitness

1.  Effects

    -   Attempts to ensure that specified Holder has an `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` for accumulator
        identified by specified Issuer and attribute index.
    -   This is possible only if
        -   a) specified Holder already has an `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` for identified accumulator for
            an `AccumulatorBatchSeqNo` that is at most the target `AccumulatorBatchSeqNo`, and
        -   b) there have been sufficient `AccumulatorAddRemove` steps performed that "update information"
            has been stored to enable updating to specified `AccumulatorBatchSeqNo`.
    -   An error is generated if these conditions do not hold.
    -   When successful, generates and stores `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` for each `AccumlatorBatchSeqNo`
        between the largest `AccumlatorBatchSeqNo` less than the target `AccumulatorBatchSeqNo` for which
        specified Holder already has an `AccumulatorMembershipWitness`.

2.  Comments

    -   Currently, a Holder will always have an `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` for every
        `AccumlatorBatchSeqNo` from the one at which its `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` was added and the
        highest `AccumlatorBatchSeqNo` to which it has ever updated.
    -   In practice, Holders would likely
        discard `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` es considered "too old".  The test framework does not
        currently support such "garbage collection".
    -   If it did, Holders could always regenerate discarded `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` es **provided**
        they retain one with `AccumlatorBatchSeqNo` at or before any future target.  If not, they would
        have to request a new `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` from the relevant Revocation Manager; the test
        framework also does not currently support this.

3.  Arguments

    -   `HolderLabel`
    -   `IssuerLabel`
    -   `CredAttrIndex`
    -   `AccumulatorBatchSeqNo`: target `AccumulatorBatchSeqNo` to ensure specified Holder

4.  API method(s) invoked

    -   `update_accumulator_witness`, potentially multiple times as described above


<a id="org964b060"></a>

### Reveal

1.  Effects

    -   adds to requirements for subsequent `CreateAndVerifyProof` steps for specified Holder,
        requiring that it reveals attributes with specified indexes from its credential
        signed by specified Issuer
    -   generates error if:
        -   specified Holder or Issuer does not exist, or
        -   no credential has been signed for specified Holder by specified Issuer, or
        -   any of specified attribute indexes is out of range established by Issuer's schema

2.  Arguments

    -   `HolderLabel`
    -   `IssuerLabel`
    -   `[ CredAttrIndex ]`: list of indexes for attributes to be revealed

3.  API method(s) invoked

    -   none


<a id="orgc497a8a"></a>

### InRange

1.  Effects

    -   adds to requirements for subsequent `CreateAndVerifyProof` steps for specified Holder,
        requiring that it proves that specified attribute in a credential signed by specified Issuer
        for specified Holder is within range specified by minimum and maximum values
    -   note that there is no step for creating a `RangeProvingKey` because one is automatically
        created when an `InRange` step is first encountered, and the same one is used for any subsequent
        `InRange` requirements

2.  Arguments

    -   `HolderLabel`
    -   `IssuerLabel`
    -   `CredAttrIndex`
    -   `i64`: the minimum value in the range
    -   `i64`: the maximum value in the range

3.  Comments

    -   Step does **not** generate an error if specified attribute is out of range, because we want to be
        able to test that `CreateAndVerifyProof` does not succeed in this case

4.  API method(s) invoked

    -   none


<a id="org2119a90"></a>

### InAccum

1.  Effects

    -   adds to requirements for subsequent `CreateAndVerifyProof` steps for specified Holder,
        requiring that it proves that specified attribute in a credential signed by specified Issuer
        for specified Holder is in the accumulator associated with specified Issuer and CredAttrIndex,
        as of specified `AccumulatorBatchSeqNo`

2.  Arguments

    -   `HolderLabel`
    -   `IssuerLabel`
    -   `CredAttrIndex`
    -   `AccumulatorBatchSeqNo`: the "batch number" for which the proof is required; enables requiring
        proof of membership in accumulator for older or newer accumulator versions

3.  API method(s) invoked

    -   none


<a id="orged9b547"></a>

### Equality

1.  Effects

    -   adds to requirements for subsequent `CreateAndVerifyProof` steps for specified Holder,
        requiring that it proves that specified attribute in a credential signed by specified Issuer is
        equal to each attribute specified in each "other" credentials (identified by specified Issuer)

2.  Arguments

    -   `HolderLabel`
    -   `IssuerLabel`: identifies Issuer who signed a credential
    -   `CredAttrIndex`: identifies an attribute in that credential
    -   `[(IssuerLabel, CredAttrIndex)]`: a list of attributes in other credentials required to be equal
        to specified attribute

3.  Comments

    -   It would have been cleaner to specify the equivalence class of `(Issuer,CredAttrIndex)` pairs,
        rather than singling on of them out
    -   Step does **not** generate an error if specified attributes are not equal, because we want to be
        able to test that `CreateAndVerifyProof` does not succeed in this case

4.  API method(s) invoked

    -   none


<a id="orgec63d18"></a>

### CreateAndVerifyProof

1.  Effects

    -   Attempts to create and then verify a proof satisfying all requirements added previously for
        specified Holder, and checks that the outcome is consistent with specified `CreateVerifyExpectation`.
    -   An error is generated if specified Holder cannot satisfy previously added requirements because,
        for example, specified Holder does not have a credential signed by an Issuer for a previously
        added requirement, does not have an `AccumulatorMembershipWitness` for a required
        `AccumlatorBatchSeqNo`, etc.
    -   note that, if previous steps include `Decrypt` requirements for specified Holder, subsequent
        `CreateAndVerifyProof` steps model an `Authority` verifying a proof created by specified Holder,
        rather than a generic Verifier; this is because the decryption requires `AuthoritySecretData` for
        each attribute to be decrypted.  If there are decryption requirements for multiple Authorities,
        the step models Verifier having `AuthoritySecretData` for all of them.  While this is not
        particularly realistic, it is useful for testing generality.

2.  Arguments

    -   `HolderLabel`
    -   `CreateVerifyExpectation`: expected outcome for attempt to create and then verify a proof
        consistent with established requirement.  Possible values are currently:
        -   `BothSucceedNoWarnings`: expects both proof creation and proof verification to succeed and
            issue no warnings.  In this case, revealed and decrypted values are checked to ensure that
            they are for exactly the requested attributes and furthermore that the values are equal to
            those signed in specified credentials.
        -   `CreateProofFails`: requires that proof creation fails
        -   `VerifyProofFails`: requires that proof creation succeeds and then verification fails
        -   `CreateOrVerifyFails`: requires that, either proof creation fails, or it succeeds but
            verification of the generated proof fails.  This expectation is sometimes useful when it is
            required that a proof is not successfully created and then verified, but it does not matter
            which step fails.  In some cases, some underlying cryptography libraries fail to generate a
            proof, while others generate a proof that does not verify successfully.  This
            `CreateVerifyExpectation` is useful in such cases.

3.  API method(s) invoked

    -   `create_proof`
    -   `verify_proof`


<a id="orgc6ccbc7"></a>

### CreateAuthority

-   Creates new Authority with associated `AuthorityData`

1.  Arguments

    -   `AuthorityLabel`: label to identify new Authority

2.  API method(s) invoked

    -   `create_authority_data`


<a id="org79ba33a"></a>

### EncryptFor

1.  Effects

    -   adds to requirements for subsequent `CreateAndVerifyProof` steps for specified Holder,
        requiring that it encrypts (for specified Authority) specified attribute from credential
        signed by specified Issuer

2.  Arguments

    -   `HolderLabel`
    -   `IssuerLabel`
    -   `CredAttrIndex`:
    -   `AuthorityLabel`: label identifying `Authority` for whom specified attribute is to be encrypted

3.  API method(s) invoked

    -   none


<a id="org5a69059"></a>

### Decrypt

1.  Effects

    -   adds to requirements for subsequent `CreateAndVerifyProof` steps for specified Holder,
        requiring that specified attribute from credential signed by specified Issuer is decrypted

2.  Arguments

    -   `HolderLabel`
    -   `IssuerLabel`
    -   `CredAttrIndex`
    -   `AuthorityLabel`: label identifying `Authority` to decrypt specified attribute

3.  API method(s) invoked

    -   none


<a id="org6e27e97"></a>

1.  Effects

    -   Verifies correct decryption for each `DecryptResponse` generated by most recent `CreateAndProof`
        step by specified Holder

2.  Arguments

    -   `HolderLabel`

3.  API method(s) invoked

    -   `verify_decryption`


<a id="orgb0843c0"></a>

## Overriding tests

Sometimes we want finer control over how specific tests are treated in combination with specific
underlying cryptography libraries.  This is supported by a per-library overrides file.  As only one
underlying library is currently supported, the only relevant overrides file is
[../../tests/data/JSON/TestSequences/LicenseSubscription/LibrarySpecificOverrides/AC2C.json](../../tests/data/JSON/TestSequences/LicenseSubscription/LibrarySpecificOverrides/AC2C.json).

For a given test with a given underlying cryptography library, it could be that:

-   although the test has SLOW or SLOWSLOW in its name, we know that it is `NotSoSlow` with
    the specific underlying library
-   the test is known to `Fail`, e.g., because of a known bug in the cryptography library
-   we want to `Skip` the test for some reason

We would like to improve the override system.  In the meantime, it is documented in
[../../generate-tests-from-json/src/lib.rs](../../generate-tests-from-json/src/lib.rs).

We note that, currently, there are a number of tests that are "overridden" to fail.  If tests are
run directly using `cargo test`, then these tests are reported as failures.  To avoid confusion, such
tests have `_overridden_to_fail` appended to their names.  Furthermore, if running tests using any of:

-   `make test`,
-   `make test-skip-slow`, or
-   `make test-skip-slow-slow`

the `Makefile` is configured to exclude tests with `_overridden_to_fail` in their names, so overriden
tests are not reported as failed.

VCP is comprised of three main parts

-   API (defined by the `PlatformAPI` type in [./api.rs](./api.rs))
    -   functions available for various roles (e.g., Issuer, Holder, Verifier, &#x2026;)
-   general
    -   implementations of API functions that operate regardless of the underlying crypto library
-   specific
    -   functions called from general that implement "primitive" crypto features (e.g., sign, prove,
        verify) for a specific underlying cryptography library (so far, only AC2C)


<a id="org27d77cf"></a>

## General

A proof is created from

-   `SignatureAndRelatedData` : signature from an Issuer on a list of `DataValue`

-   `CredentialReqs` : the requirements for each credential
    (e.g., values in range, what values should be revealed, &#x2026;)
-   Shared Params : the values referenced from `CredentialReqs`

A proof is verified from

-   `CredentialReqs` and shared params
-   `DataForVerifier` : includes disclosed values and a proof (created by `create_proof`)
-   `DecryptReqs` : verifiable decryption requests

Both the general `create_proof` and `verify_proof` call `presentation_request_setup`.
That function transforms shared parameters and human-friendly `CredentialReqs` into machine-friendly
`resolved_proof_instructions` and `equality_requirements`.

Both the general `create_proof` and `verify_proof` then pass that info to "specific" versions of
create and verify.  The AC2C versions are shown in the above diagram.


<a id="org7c7243b"></a>

## Specific

`specific_prover_ac2c` turns `SignatureAndRelatedData` into `anoncreds-v2-rs` "credentials"
(via `presentation_credentials_from`).

Both `specific_prover_ac2c` and `specific_verifier_ac2c` call `presentation_schema_from`
with `resolved_proof_instructions` and `equality_requirements` to create an
`anoncreds-v2-rs` presentation schema.

`specific_prover_ac2c` uses the `anoncreds-v2-rs` credentials and presentation schema to create a proof.
That proof is then converted to an opaque `Proof` and included in the `DataForVerifier` API type, along with disclosed values.

`specific_verifier_ac2c` uses the `DataForVerifier` and the `anoncreds-v2-rs` presentation schema
to verify the proof.

## Example of connecting a specific crypto library to `PlatformApi`

In [./impl/ac2c/impl_ac2c.rs](./impl/ac2c/impl_ac2c.rs), the AC2C implementation initializes a `CryptoInterface`
([./interfaces/crypto_interface.rs](./interfaces/crypto_interface.rs)) struct with "pointers" to the AC2C implementation of
[./interfaces/primitives.rs](./interfaces/primitives.rs). That initialized struct is referenced as `CRYPTO_INTERFACE_AC2C`.

`CRYPTO_INTERFACE_AC2C` is passed to `implement_platform_api_using` (defined in [./api_utils.rs](./api_utils.rs))
to create an instance of `PlatformApi`.  Many of the primitives are directly assigned to `PlatformApi` fields.

The `specific_prover`, `specific_verifier`, `specific_verify_decryption` values are first passed to
the non-primitive, `create_proof`, `verify_proof`, and `verify_decryption` functions to create a higher-level
`PlatformAPI` function, which are then assigned to their associated fields.

An example of making this connection can be seen in the `run_json_test_ac2c` function in
[../../tests/vcp/impl/general/testing_framework/utils.rs](../../tests/vcp/impl/general/testing_framework/utils.rs).

## Creating an Issuer's public and secret data (e.g., keys)

To prepare for signing credentials, an Issuer uses `create_signer_data` in `PlatformApi` ([./api.rs](./api.rs)).

The type of that function, `CreateSignerData`, is defined in [./interfaces/primitives.rs](./interfaces/primitives.rs).

It takes

-   a `Natural` (an RNG seed), and
-   a list of `ClaimType` (both defined in [./interfaces/types.rs](./interfaces/types.rs))
    -   this is the "schema" for credentials that will be issued and signed by the Issuer

Assuming the AC2C implementation of primitives are connected to `PlatformApi`,
as described in <a id="orgfbcb666"></a>,
then `create_signer_data` (in [./impl/ac2c/signer.rs](./impl/ac2c/signer.rs)) is invoked.

The `create_signer_data` implementation

-   creates an AC2C schema representation based on a list of VCP `ClaimType`
-   creates AC2C public and secret data (that includes public/secret keys)
-   returns VCP `SignerData`

`SignerData` ([./interfaces/types.rs](./interfaces/types.rs)) contains

-   `SignerSecretData`
    -   an opaque representation of the AC2C secret data
-   `SignerPublicData`
    -   an opaque representation of the AC2C public data
    -   a vector of `ClaimType` (i.e., the "schema")

An Issuer would securely store the private data and make the public data available.


<a id="orgb8da9fa"></a>

## Issuer signing a credential

To sign credentials, an Issuer uses the `PlatformApi` ([./api.rs](./api.rs)) `sign` function
of type `Sign` ([./interfaces/primitives.rs](./interfaces/primitives.rs)).

It takes

-   a `Natural` (an RNG seed)
-   a list of `DataValue` ([./interfaces/types.rs](./interfaces/types.rs))
-   `SignerData` (from `create_signer_data` above)

The AC2C implementation of `sign` is in [./impl/ac2c/signer.rs](./impl/ac2c/signer.rs).

That `sign` implementation

-   converts each VCP `DataValue` to an AC2C claim
-   uses AC2C to sign the claims using the secret data from `SignerData`
-   returns a `Signature` (an opaque representation of an AC2C signature)


<a id="org7e4be50"></a>

## Creating a proof

The general `create_proof` function ([./impl/general/proof.rs](./impl/general/proof.rs)) takes

-   proof requirements : `HashMap<CredentialLabel, CredentialReqs>`
    -   `CredentialLabel`
        -   an identifier used to refer to a credential for which a Prover must
            prove knowledge of a signature satisfying the associated `CredentialReqs`, as well as
            for establishing equalities between attributes
            in different credentials
    -   `CredentialReqs` ([./interfaces/types.rs](./interfaces/types.rs))
        -   what is required to be proved (e.g., reveal values, accumulator membership, &#x2026;)
-   shared parameters : `HashMap<SharedParamKey, SharedParamValue>`
    -   `SharedParamKey`
        -   an identifier used in `CredentialReqs` (above) to specify a value contained in shared parameters
    -   `SharedParamValue`
        -   a value, e.g., range min/max, Issuer public data
-   signatures, etc : `HashMap<CredentialLabel, SignatureAndRelatedData>`
    -   provides `SignatureAndRelatedData` for each credential referenced in proof requirements
    -   `SignatureAndRelatedData` contains
        -   `Signature`
            -   used to create a proof-of-knowledge
        -   list of `DataValue`
            -   the values that we used to create the signature
        -   `AccumulatorWitnesses`
            -   set membership witnesses for any accumulators in the requirements (could be none)
        -   `Option<Nonce>`
            -   An optional `Nonce` agreed between Prover and Verifier to avoid replay attacks

Using the above input, the general `create_proof` function

-   gets the values to reveal from the list of `DataValue`
-   transforms human-friendly `CredentialReqs` into machine-friendly "proof instructions" and equality requirements
    -   via `presentation_request_setup` ([./impl/general/presentation_request_setup.rs](./impl/general/presentation_request_setup.rs))
    -   TODO: clarify relationship between `CredentialReqs` and proof instructions, `ResolvedDisclosure` and `SupportedDisclosure`, relate `ResolvedDisclosure` to feature-specific sections below, note special `CredentialResolved` one, etc.
-   validates the `CredentialReqs` against schemas
-   calls the specific crypto library function `specific_prover`

The AC2C `specific_prover` (named `specific_prover_ac2c` in [./impl/ac2c/proof.rs](./impl/ac2c/proof.rs))

-   creates an AC2C `Presentation` (i.e., "proof") ([../presentation.rs](../presentation.rs))
-   wraps that proof in a VCP opaque data type
-   returns `DataForVerifier` that contains the VCP proof and any warnings


<a id="org83e786c"></a>

## Verifying a proof

Like the general `create_proof` function,
the general `verify_proof` function ([./impl/general/proof.rs](./impl/general/proof.rs)) takes

-   proof requirements : `HashMap<CredentialLabel, CredentialReqs>`
-   shared parameters : `HashMap<SharedParamKey, SharedParamValue>`
-   `Option<Nonce>`

It also takes a `DataForVerifier` produced by `create_proof`.

After transforming `CredentialReqs` into proof instructions and equality requirements and
after validating those requirements against schemas it calls the `specific_verifier` function.

The AC2C `specific_verifier` (named `specific_verifier_ac2c` in [./impl/ac2c/proof.rs](./impl/ac2c/proof.rs))
converts the VCP information and data into formats used by AC2C, and then calls
the AC2C `Presentation:verify` to verify the proof.


<a id="org9f422ab"></a>

## Proofs with revealed values

Attributes whose values are to be revealed are specified in the `disclosed: Disclosed` field of `CredentialReqs`.

`Disclosed` ([./interfaces/types.rs](./interfaces/types.rs)) is a list of indices into the list of `DataValue` that were signed,
specifying which values should be disclosed.

Both the general `create_proof` and `verify_proof` functions ([./impl/general/proof.rs](./impl/general/proof.rs)) call
`presentation_request_setup` ([./impl/general/presentation_request_setup.rs](./impl/general/presentation_request_setup.rs)) that calls
`get_proof_instructions` to transform `CredentialReqs` into proof instructions.
For each credential request, the translation happens in `get_proof_instructions_for_cred`.

For revealed values, the `ProofInstructionGeneral` that gets returned is
`ResolvedDisclosure::CredentialResolvedWrapper(CredentialResolved`.  It contains

-   `SignerPublicData`
-   for each reveal value: a list of tuples : `(index, value, ClaimType)`

Both the general `create_proof` and `verify_proof` functions go on to call their specific variants,
in the AC2C case, `specific_prover_ac2c` and `specific_verifier_ac2c` ([./impl/ac2c/proof.rs](./impl/ac2c/proof.rs)).

The specific functions call `presentation_schema_from` which calls
`transform_instruction` ([./impl/ac2c/presentation_request_setup.rs](./impl/ac2c/presentation_request_setup.rs)) to
transform the `ProofInstructionGeneral<ResolvedDisclosure>` into a
`ProofInstructionGeneral<SupportedDisclosure>`.
That function returns a proof instruction that contains `SupportedDisclosure::SignatureAndReveal` that contains

-   an `anoncreds-v2-rs` `IssuerPublic`
-   `HashMap<CredAttrIndex, (DataValue, ClaimType)>`

`SupportedDisclosure` is then given to `generate_statements` ([./impl/ac2c/presentation_request_setup.rs](./impl/ac2c/presentation_request_setup.rs)).
For `SupportedDisclosure::SignatureAndReveal`, `generate_statements` creates an `anoncreds-v2-rs`
`SignatureStatement` containing

-   the disclosed information
-   a statement ID
-   `anoncreds-v2-rs` `IssuerPublic`

The `anoncreds-v2-rs` statements returned from `generate_statements` are given to
`anoncreds-v2-rs` `PresentationSchema::new_with_id`, which is then returned from
`presentation_schema_from`.

At this point `specific_prover_ac2c` calls `anoncreds-v2-rs` `Presentation::create` with

-   the `PresentationSchema`
-   `anoncreds-v2-rs` `IndexMap<CredentialLabel, PresentationCredential>`
    -   created by a call to `presentation_credentials_from` ([./impl/ac2c/proof.rs](./impl/ac2c/proof.rs))

That `anoncreds-v2-rs` `Presentation` (i.e., proof) is returned from `specific_prover_ac2c`.

In the `specific_verifier_ac2c` case, it calls `anoncreds-v2-rs` `Presentation::verify` with
the `PresentationSchema` to verify the proof.


<a id="org0caaa29"></a>

## Proofs with range proofs

Range proofs are requirements in the `in_range: InRange` field of `CredentialReqs`.

`InRange` ([./interfaces/types.rs](./interfaces/types.rs)) is a list of `InRangeInfo` that contain

-   an index specifying which value in the list of `DataValue` to be used
-   a `min_label` : a key into shared parameters; that key maps to the actual minimum value
-   a `max_label` : a key into shared parameters; that key maps to the actual maximum value
-   `proving_key_label` : a key into shared parameters; that key maps to an instance of  `RangeProofProvingKey`

For range proofs,
`ResolvedDisclosure::InRangeResolvedWrapper(InRangeResolved` is created. It contains

-   `min_val`     : looked up from shared parameters
-   `max_val`     : looked up from shared parameters
-   `proving_key` : looked up from shared parameters
-   (the index is also collected into the outer `ProofInstructionGeneral`)

The AC2C implementation then transforms that `ResolvedDisclosure` into
`SupportedDisclosure::RangeProof` that contains

-   the `anoncreds-v2-rs` range proving key
-   the min and max values
-   the index

`SupportedDisclosure::RangeProof`  is given to `generate_statements`
which creates two `anoncreds-v2-rs` statements:

-   `CommitmentStatement`
-   `RangeStatement`

Those statements are then used to create and verify proofs

## Proofs with verifiable encryption

Verifiable encryption requirements are specified in the `encrypted_for: EncryptedFor` field of `CredentialReqs`.

`EncryptedFor` ([./interfaces/types.rs](./interfaces/types.rs)) is a list of `IndexAndLabel` that contain

-   an index specifying which value in the list of `DataValue` to be encrypted
-   a `label` : a key into shared parameters; that key maps to the public data that should be used for encryption.

For verifiable encryption,
`ResolvedDisclosure::EncryptedForResolvedWrapper(EncryptedForResolved` is created. It contains

-   the API public data to be used for encryption

The AC2C implementation then transforms that `ResolvedDisclosure` into
`SupportedDisclosure::EncryptedFor` that contains

-   the `anoncreds-v2-rs` verifiable encryption public key

`SupportedDisclosure::EncryptedFor`  is given to `generate_statements`
which creates a `anoncreds-v2-rs` `VerifiableEncryptionStatement`

TODO `verify_decryption`

## Proofs with equalities between credentials

Equality requirements are specified in the `equal_to: EqualTo` field of `CredentialReqs`.

`EqualTo` ([./interfaces/types.rs](./interfaces/types.rs)) is a list of `EqInfo` that contain

-   `from_index` : an index specifying which value in the list of `DataValue` to be used in equality checking
-   `to_label`   : a label specifying a `CredentialReqs`
-   `to_index`   : index into the `DataValue` of the `to_label` credential to be used in equality checking

General `presentation_request_setup` calls `equality_reqs_from_pres_reqs_general` to create

-   `EqualityReqs = Vec<EqualityReq>`
-   `EqualityReq  = Vec<(CredentialLabel, CredAttrIndex)>`

where each `EqualityReq` is a list of pairs that point to values that should be equal.

`EqualityReqs` is given to `specific_prover`.  In the AC2C case, `specific_prover_ac2c` calls
`presentation_schema_from` ([./impl/ac2c/presentation_request_setup.rs](./impl/ac2c/presentation_request_setup.rs)) with those `EqualityReqs`.
`presentation_schema_from` pass those to `generate_equality_statements` to create a `anoncreds-v2-rs`
`EqualityStatement` for each equality.

## Proofs with accumulators

Verifiable encryption requirements are specified in the `in_accum: InAccum` field of `CredentialReqs`.

`InAccum` ([./interfaces/types.rs](./interfaces/types.rs)) is a list of `InAccumInfo` that contain

-   an index specifying which value in the list of `DataValue` represents an accumlator element TODO
-   `public_data_label` : a key into shared parameters; that key maps to `AccumulatorPublicData`
-   `mem_prv_label`     : a key into shared parameters; that key maps to a `MembershipProvingKey`
-   `accumulator_label` : a key into shared parameters; that key maps to an `Accumulator`
-   `accumulator_seq_no_label` : a key into shared parameters; that key maps to the sequence number of the accumulator

For accumulators
`ResolvedDisclosure::InAccumResolvedWrapper(InAccumResolved` is created. It contains

-   the API values obtained from the keys in `InAccum`

The AC2C implementation then transforms that `ResolvedDisclosure` into
`SupportedDisclosure::InAccumProof` that contains

-   the `anoncreds-v2-rs` `vb20::PublicKey` for accumulators
-   the `anoncreds-v2-rs` `vb20::Accumulator` accumulator

`SupportedDisclosure::InAccumProof` is given to `generate_statements`
which creates a `anoncreds-v2-rs` `MembershipStatement`

## Accumulator functions

There are functions for ([./api.rs](./api.rs), [./interfaces/primitives.rs](./interfaces/primitives.rs))

-   creating accumulators (and their associated keys)
-   creating accumulator elements from `DataValue`
-   adding and removing elements from accumulators and getting witnesses for those elements
-   updating existing witnesses after elements have been added to or removed from an accumulator

The AC2C versions are in [./impl/ac2c/accumulator.rs](./impl/ac2c/accumulator.rs).
